      //- Use the Pug `each` iterator to loop over the projects in your data file      
        //- Use the example Pug code below and interpolated template literals as needed to dynamically generate:
          //- The paths in the link's href and img's src attributes
          //- The text 'Thumbnail' interpolated with the project title for the img's alt attribute
          //- The project title for the h5 element's text
      each project in data
        .cell
          a(href=`${project.live_link}`)
            img.thumbnail(src=`/static/${project.image_urls[0].square}`, alt='Project preview picture as square icon')
            h5= project.project_name
